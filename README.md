You will   be   provided with a client   brief who   require   a webpage   to   be   developed.   Your   task   will   be   to investigate different competitors, analyse different   strategies   and   develop   a   proposal   design   of what   the   product will   look   like. You should take   into consideration various   UX fundamentals,   UI   principles      and web standards. You will   be   provided with some   assets   of the   brand to   include   in   your   proposal.    The goal   is for your final webpage design to   be thoroughly   explored   and   considerate   of the   various factors that the   brand and   product   require.

Second,   research and analyse existing competitors for   insights.   Consider   competitors   in   the   same product   line,   but also those who   hold the same value   as the   brand   though   in   a   different   product   line.
Third, explore your   initial design   ideas   using wireframes. Wireframes   allow you to   explore   quickly and efficiently various compositions, and to consider   the   strategy   and   funnel   that   a   composition   can   have for   users as they   navigate the   page. These should   be created   in   industry   standard   UI   software. 
Fourth, create your final   high-fidelity visual design of the   home   page.   It   should   incorporate   various ideas   uncovered during your   research   into the   users, competitors and wireframing.   Industry   practice   is to   present the finished design of a   webpage to   the   client   before   coding   it.
The document submitted should   present a   clear   summary   of your findings,   thoughts   and   ideas   and   should   look and feel   professional.
